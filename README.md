# Katik

Katik is a simple web application designed to calculate the area and perimeter of two-dimensional shapes, especially triangles and parallelograms. The app uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and can run in any modern web browser.

## Usage

When you first launch the app, you will see a navigation bar with two links: Triangle and Parallelogram. Clicking on each link will take you to a section of the page where you can calculate the area and perimeter of that particular shape.

In the Triangle section, you will see two card components, one for calculating the area and another for calculating the perimeter. Each card has a form where you can enter the required parameters, such as base and height for area and three sides for perimeter. Clicking on the Calculate button will display the result below the form. You can also reset the form by clicking on the Reset button.

In the Parallelogram section, you will see two similar cards for calculating the area and perimeter of a parallelogram. The required parameters are base, height, and two sides for area and four sides for perimeter.

## Installation

You don't need to install anything to use Katik. Simply download the source code from this repository and open the index.html file in any modern web browser. Alternatively, you can access the app online at [Katik](https://jufrensius.github.io/revou_sefc_f.github.io/).

## Development

If you want to modify or improve Katik, you can fork this repository and make changes to the source code. You will need a code editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), and a web browser to test your changes.

The app consists of three files: index.html, index.css, and index.js. The HTML file contains the basic structure of the app, including the navigation bar, the title, and the two sections for triangles and parallelograms. The CSS file contains the styles for the app, such as the layout, the colors, and the fonts. The JavaScript file contains the logic for the app, such as the calculation functions and the event listeners.

To test your changes, open the index.html file in your web browser and make sure everything works as expected. You can also use a web server, such as [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for Visual Studio Code, to run the app locally and see the changes in real-time.
